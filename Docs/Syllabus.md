## Outline

The course is organised in three blocks (ethical issues, ethical requests, ethical commitment, loosely following Simon Critchley's [Infinitely Demanding](https://www.versobooks.com/books/1135-infinitely-demanding) structure of disappointment, request, and commitment). Each block contains one hands-on-data laboratory, three guided discussion sessions, and four frontal lectures.

The hands-on-data laboratory are based on R via [Stenci.la](https://stenci.la/) (but students can choose to use any other programming language they and the instructor are familiar with). Each guided discussion requires the students to perform some preliminary reading. Frontal lectures follow laboratories and add rigour, deep and context to students understanding.
