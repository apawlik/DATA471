## Overview

DATA471 will stimulate students to think about the ethical facets of their data scientific projects and provide them with conceptual and practical tools to assess the projects. The ethics and security of data collection, storage, manipulation, analysis and communication is of paramount importance in our information based society. This course faces these topics from the point of view of data scientists—rather than consumers or data subjects—enabling the student to become trustworthy professionals. The students will learn to identify risk and opportunities related to fairness, agency, interpretability, and security. Māori Data Sovereigneity, Te Mana Raraunga, and its relevance for data scientist in New Zealand will be introduced. The course will follow a flipped class-room flow. Fundamental concepts will be first introduce via guided discussions and hands-on-data exercises during the laboratories. In the lectures, the understanding of concepts and tools introduced in the laboratories is made rigorous and generalised. 

The course will provide a safe and supportive environment in which students can express their ideas, explore their ethical frameworks and collaborate to find common ground. Students will need to be familiar with basic data science concepts and techniques.


## Learning outcomes 

At the end of this course, students will be able to:
    • Identify ethical risks (biases, privacy violations, …)  in data science projects.
    • Prevent, mitigate, or remediate unethical data science projects.
    • Perform rudimentary data anonymization techniques and explain their importance.
    • Understand other stakeholders’ ethical requests.
    • Identify when Te Mana Raraunga is relevant in a data science project.
 
 ## Assessments

The course will be assessed by active partecipation, participation in assignments posted on LEARN, and a final group project as follows:

### Active partecipation 10%
The students will be asked to keep a learning journal (self-reflection) and to collaborate as a class in a course wiki (community based knowledge mapping).

#### Three assignments (20% each) — evenly spready across the course.
The course is organised in three blocks (ethical problems, ethical requests, ethical commitment). Each block has two hands-on-data laboratory and two class discussion sessions. By the end of each block, students are asked to submit their hands-on-data exercises and a short summary of the class discussions. 

#### Group Project 30% — end of course
In the final group project students will be asked to develop a data science deliverable (report, dashboard, webpage, database, …). The students will have to show that they considered the ethical facets of their project and used what they learnt in class.
